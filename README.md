# FirebaseDemo
Below is the demo of new changes made by Android via Firebase. I have developed Notifications, Storage, Authentication, DB and Crash Report. Also I have been working on dynamic linking and hosting (which I will implement at my earliest).



After Google I/O 16, I was really fascinated by how all it works and superbly fast with firebase.
Now Andorid is using Firebase for many of its functionalities like notifictaions, storage, crashes, etc.

Below is the demo of new changes made by Android via Firebase.
I have developed Notifications, Storage, Authentication, DB and Crash Report.
Also I have been working on dynamic linking and hosting (which I will implement at my earliest).

Kindly download and just do the following steps (as it requires your own project credentials).

1) Create a firebase account.
Link : https://console.firebase.google.com 

2) Create your Project with same Application Id (in our demo its, "com.example.dhaval.newfirebasedemo").

3) Download google-services.json from your account.

3) Just copy and paste above file in app folder of your Project.


And then just execute the project ... :)

I hope you will like it and kindly let me know if it requires any further more changes.
